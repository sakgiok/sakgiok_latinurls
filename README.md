# sakgiok_latinurls
A prestashop module for creating friendly urls for products from product name, converting non-latin characters to latin.
## Features
* Uses an array of regular expressions to convert characters from one charset to another (currently with only greek tables). You can easily create your own table and use it.
* It can automatically create the friendly urls when saving a product (can be deactivated).
* It can create the friendly urls for all existing products on demand.
* It has a pause and continue feature, to avoid server timeouts when a big number of products is processed.
* It displays a list of all products with their friendly urls (in multiple languages).
* Multi-language and multi shop compatible.
* Prestashop 1.6.x and 1.7.x compatible.
## Installation
Just like any prestashop module. Just zip the sakgiok_latinurls folder and upload your zip file to the prestashop modules page, selecting to add a module.
